A Pádraig O'Keeffe manuscript cited by Matt Cranitch suggests that the tune might have been called The Star and Garter before SATG was published in 1969.

Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]. Ciarán Mac Mathúna (1925–2009) was a prominent music collector and broadcaster who helped popularise traditional music both at home and abroad. MacMathúna joined RTÉ in late 1954, see MFCK for a separate collection of DM recordings he made; see MCTH and TOMH for archival selections of Denis's music from MacMathúna's long-running Sunday morning radio programme Mo Cheol Thú."

O'Donnell was one of the leaders of the resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland who was forced to flee to continental Europe alongside Hugh O'Neill, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls, after their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]. Ciarán Mac Mathúna (1925–2009) was a prominent music collector and broadcaster who helped popularise traditional music both at home and abroad. MacMathúna joined RTÉ in late 1954, see MFCK for a separate collection of DM recordings he made; see MCTH and TOMH for archival selections of Denis's music from MacMathúna's long-running Sunday morning radio programme Mo Cheol Thú."

It's not clear how it got christened “Muckross Abbey” on KEFI but Charlie didn't have a name for this reel and it is still unclear whether he wrote it. According to Charlie's son Tommy Mulvihill, Charlie used to play this tune frequently in a set with another untitled reel (JOLSL # 204): see HD22 for a recording of Denis and Charlie playing them together. The same set was taped by Charlie Mulvihill's long-time friend Lad O'Beirne in a duet with Louis E. Quinn at an unknown date [AZ]"

Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]"

A Pádraig O'Keeffe manuscript cited by Matt Cranitch suggests that the tune might have been called The Star and Garter before SATG was published in 1969.

It is also possible that the tune had developed separately from Monaghan Twig's apparent Scottish ancestor, the strathspey Alasdair MacAlasdair (Allister McAllister), some versions of which are musically very similar to CICD 4273 / CICD 1349 while a version found in RMC (“Alistair MacAlastair”) has apparently been turned into a Sliabh Luachra polka, now known as Denis Doody's (a version of the Green Cottage No. 1) [AZ]."

In JOLSL, Johnny O'Leary calls this reel after Charlie Mulvihill, the apparent source of this tune for Denis. According to Charlie's son Tommy Mulvihill, Charlie used to play these two tunes frequently (the second was later christened “Muckross Abbey” on KEFI) but it's not clear whether he wrote any of them. John Carty called this reel Lad O'Beirne's and suggested Johnny McGreevy might have wrote it – but this proved to be uncertain and there's no known recording of McGreevy playing this it. The same set was taped by Charlie Mulvihill's long-time friend Lad O'Beirne in a duet with Louis E. Quinn [AZ]"

Denis Murphy's version is distinct from others, such as CRE 1 # 50, and he apparently learned it from Pádraig O'Keeffe.

O'Donnell was one of the leaders of the resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland who was forced to flee to continental Europe alongside Hugh O'Neill, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls, after their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]"

MFSL notes suggest that the name of the air refers to Hugh Roe O'Donnell, Lord of Tyrconnell (1572–1602). O'Donnell was one of the leaders of the resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland who was forced to flee to continental Europe alongside Hugh O'Neill, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls, after their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]"

NB: This is apparently a version of Garrett Barry's reel played in D. According to Tunearch / Andrew Kuntz, Garrett Barry's is in turn a version of Miss McLeod's Reel (Mrs MacLeod of Raasay). In JOLSL, Johnny O'Leary calls this reel after Charlie Mulvihill, the apparent source of this tune for Denis. According to Charlie's son Tommy Mulvihill, Charlie used to play these two tunes frequently (the second was later christened “Muckross Abbey” on KEFI) but it's not clear whether he wrote any of them. John Carty called this reel Lad O'Beirne's and suggested Johnny McGreevy might have wrote it – but this proved to be uncertain and there's no known recording of McGreevy playing this it. The same set was taped by Charlie Mulvihill's long-time friend Lad O'Beirne in a duet with Louis E. Quinn [AZ]"
