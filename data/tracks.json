MFSL notes say that the title might be referring to the insignia of Order of the Garter, an order of chivalry founded in the 14th-century England. A Pádraig O'Keeffe manuscript cited by Matt Cranitch suggests that the tune might have originally been called The Star and Garter, which is a common informal abbreviation of the order’s insignia. If so, it is unclear when the Sliabh Luachra musicians creatively changed the name but apparently it happened well before SATG came out in 1969."

O'Donnell was one of the leaders of the resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland who was forced to flee to continental Europe alongside Hugh O'Neill, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls, after their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]. Ciarán Mac Mathúna (1925–2009) was a prominent music collector and broadcaster who helped popularise traditional music both at home and abroad. MacMathúna joined RTÉ in late 1954, see MFCK for a separate collection of DM recordings he made; see MCTH and TOMH for archival selections of Denis's music from MacMathúna's long-running Sunday morning radio programme Mo Cheol Thú."

It's not clear how it got christened “Muckross Abbey” on KEFI but Charlie didn't have a name for this reel and it is still unclear whether he wrote it. According to Charlie's son Tommy Mulvihill, Charlie used to play this tune frequently in a set with another untitled reel (JOLSL # 204): see HD22 for a recording of Denis and Charlie playing them together. The same set was taped by Charlie Mulvihill's long-time friend Lad O'Beirne in a duet with Louis E. Quinn at an unknown date [AZ]"

O'Donnell was one of the leaders of the resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland who was forced to flee to continental Europe alongside Hugh O'Neill, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls, after their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\". Denis's version of the air apparently comes from Pádraig O'Keeffe [AZ]"

MFSL notes say that the title might be referring to the insignia of Order of the Garter, an order of chivalry founded in the 14th-century England. A Pádraig O'Keeffe manuscript cited by Matt Cranitch suggests that the tune might have originally been called The Star and Garter, which is a common informal abbreviation of the order’s insignia. If so, it is unclear when the Sliabh Luachra musicians creatively changed the name but apparently it happened well before SATG came out in 1969."

On both known recordings of Denis Murphy playing this tune he pairs it with Art O'Keeffe's slide (JOLSL # 345) and is apparently accompanied by his neighbour Art O'Keeffe on the tinwhistle, making it possible both tunes come from the repertoire of Art O'Keeffe or were at least associated with him [AZ]."

This reel has structural similarities to The Monaghan Twig / Tinker's Apron and appears to be a distinct minor version or a relative thereof (see CRE 2 # 152 for another version of that reel). It is also possible that the tune had developed separately from Monaghan Twig's apparent Scottish ancestor, the strathspey Alasdair MacAlasdair (Allister McAllister), some versions of which are musically very similar to CICD 4273 / CICD 1349 while a version found in RMC (“Alistair MacAlastair”) has apparently been turned into a Sliabh Luachra polka, now known as Denis Doody's (a version of the Green Cottage No. 1) [AZ]."

Denis Murphy’s version apparently derives from the evolution of the tune that is common in the old-time fiddle tradition and is markedly different from the 18th-century manuscript. Despite invariably being called “Durang’s Hornpipe”, the performance of the tune would usually have an old-timey reel feel, something Denis and other Sliabh Luachra musicians have taken even further, carrying it into faster tempos of the Irish reel [AZ]."

Denis Murphy has been recorded telling a story possibly inspired by a corrupted Irish title of the air – The Queen of O'Donnell – which describes a dying man, who fell sick after dancing in poisoned shoes at a party, being visited by an angelic woman that proceeds to sing this lament. In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\".

According to Tunearch / Andrew Kuntz, Garrett Barry's is in turn a version of Miss McLeod's Reel (Mrs MacLeod of Raasay). In JOLSL, Johnny O'Leary calls this reel after Charlie Mulvihill, the apparent source of this tune for Denis. According to Charlie's son Tommy Mulvihill, Charlie used to play these two tunes frequently (the second was later christened “Muckross Abbey” on KEFI) but it's not clear whether he wrote any of them. John Carty called this reel Lad O'Beirne's and suggested Johnny McGreevy might have wrote it – but this proved to be uncertain and there's no known recording of McGreevy playing this it.

MFSL notes say that the title might be referring to the insignia of Order of the Garter, an order of chivalry founded in the 14th-century England. A Pádraig O'Keeffe manuscript cited by Matt Cranitch suggests that the tune might have originally been called The Star and Garter, which is a common informal abbreviation of the order’s insignia. If so, it is unclear when the Sliabh Luachra musicians creatively changed the name but apparently it happened well before SATG came out in 1969."

Johnny recorded this hornpipe under the name of Mike Sullivan's. Terry Teahan called the same tune How Are You, Mary Geaney? in SLOP # 78 where it's categorised as a barndance.

In Pádraig O'Keeffe's version of the same story it is \"the banshee of the O'Donnells\" who \"cried after the Queen of the O'Donnells\".

This reel is sometimes named after fiddle player Cal O'Callaghan (1863-?), who was Pádraig O'Keeffe's uncle from Doon (Doonasleen), Kishkeam, Co. Cork and apparently a source of many popular tunes passed on via Pádraig and Denis. The alternative title “Now She's Purring” reportedly comes from an appreciative comment of a listener who uttered the phrase after hearing Denis launch into a set of tunes on the fiddle."
