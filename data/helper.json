After each Track is researched and identified, the Tunes played there are given short code names that also serve as a reference to printed collections of Irish music.

You can contribute to #ProjectDenis in several ways: by making detailed tracklists of recordings not found in the database or by submitting publicly accessible transcriptions of Denis Murphy’s tunes that will then be verified against the source recording and added to the Tune DB. Of course, it’s not the notes and the lists that are important but the personal journey through the recordings that we take and the musical legacy of Denis that we pass on in the process. I hope that this project has aided you in connecting to the source material of this wonderful musician – please send me any feedback that you have! This project would not have been possible without all the people and sources that came before and the help of Billy Clifford, the Irish Traditional Music Archive and the Friends of Sliabh Luachra in particular. Up Sliabh Luachra!",
