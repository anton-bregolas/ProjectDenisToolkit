#ProjectDenis Toolkit
========================================================================================
#ProjectDenis Toolkit is a set of simple tools for building, updating and testing the database for the prototype project in tribute to the Sliabh Luachra music legend, fiddle player Denis Murphy (1910â€“1974).

When toolkitMode is set to 1 in `dm-toolkit.js` it turns off fetch functions and reveals GUI for parsing .tsv files imported from Google Sheets
